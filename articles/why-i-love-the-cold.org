#+TITLE: Why I Love: The Cold

#+DESCRIPTION: Brrr.
Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice, I say through someone making what could be described as a
catastrophic diplomatic failure, but I wouldn't mind the world ending in ice. I adore the cold.

I tend to remember why I love the cold as soon as the weather starts to warm up. Days get hotter, days get more humid, I
get more miserable. Sure, the sun is nice and all... until I start to actually spend time in it.

I hold those winter nights where the air is cold and you wrap a thick blanket around yourself while you work away at
whatever it is needs to be done in very high regard. There's nothing that beats the serene comfort of coziness, and
coziness is best experienced in winter.

In the cold, you tend to become more focused, more aware, more awake. I absolutely adore this useful little property of
low temperatures. In the heat, you get hot, sweaty, and sluggish. No fun wiping sweat away when you're trying to just
get something done.

Not to mention the beauty of winter. The simple formation of tiny formations of ice as frost on grass is such a
fascinating process, a land of green suddenly encrusted with white, glittery crystals. While ice can be very dangerous,
it can also be simply gorgeous.

Not to mention cold air. I don't know what the cold might do for air quality, but when I breathe in crisp, winter air, I
tend to feel as if it is almost *cleaner*. It's probably just the cooling sensation as I breathe, but it's a sensation I
enjoy nonetheless.

I don't just enjoy cold weather. I also just enjoy cold environments. This is the strangest part for most people. I used
to work in a food-production factory where some of my duties involved spending time in the industrial freezers. I
absolutely *loved* it. Wearing nothing but my uniform polo vest, boots, trousers, and hairnet, I would build pallets, pull
out ingredients, and sometimes just hide for a bit. It felt /great./

I could work hard in the cold, too. While your body attempting to regulate temperature uses a lot of energy, especially
in the cold, not getting hot and sweaty meant that I was comfortable to keep going for much longer. I could do a lot
more than I could normally, which had a tendency to surprise me when I attempted to do some of the same work outside of
the freezer.

This adoration for temperatures most might describe as a bit nippy (Approximately minus thirteen degrees Celsius, if
memory serves) only intensified during the height of that summer. A steel-roofed production floor with very little in
the way of temperature control meant I tended to volunteer to do more work in the fridges and freezers, eventually
getting to the point where I'd stop what I was doing to stand in the freezer for a bit. 

So, if the sun would just get a bit cooler for me, that'd be excellent. I can't be dealing with all this "sunshine" and
"fabulous days."
