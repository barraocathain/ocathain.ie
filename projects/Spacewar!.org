#+TITLE: Spacewar!
* A Space Combat Game, Based On The First (popular) /Computer/ Game!
"Spacewar!" is a 2D multiplayer space combat game, where players orbit a black
hole and attempt to shoot each other down. "Spacewar!" is currently under active
development, and I'm currently in the process of learning how to write good
netcode for action games with Client Side Prediction Test.
