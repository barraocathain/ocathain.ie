#+TITLE: Client-Side Prediction Test
* A Simple Simulation For Learning Various Netcode Techniques
I realized that the current net-code of Spacewar was fine for simply running two
instances of the game on the same computer; but it would not hold up to
latencies of actual networks nor would it be able to do any structured
communication due to being entirely over UDP. I knew this when writing it, but I
needed to learn how to do it properly first. Hence, this repository. I will be
keeping notes on the techniques and a devlog as I come up against any issues.
