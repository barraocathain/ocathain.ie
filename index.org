* Welcome!
Hi! I'm Barra. Here you can find my projects, or anything I happen to mull over
long enough to write it down. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
Computer Science, and developing a hackable "terminal-top" role-playing game
engine.

The tabs at the top of the page can be used to navigate to the various sections
of the site. Clicking them will bring you to the list of pages in that section.
